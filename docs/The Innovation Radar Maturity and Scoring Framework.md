Based on the **Innovation Radar** methodology adapted for business diagnostics, the scoring system is designed to measure the **maturity** and **systematic nature** of innovation within the company.  
The scores 1 through 5 represent a progression from **passivity** to **systematic leadership**. According to the research, specifically the framework adapted by Bachmann and Destefani, the scores can be defined as follows:

### The Scoring Rubric (1 to 5\)

The primary distinction between a low score (1) and a high score (5) is whether innovation is a **random occurrence** or a **managed, systematic process**.

#### Score 1: Little or No Innovation ("The Static Company")

A score of 1 indicates that the company is reactive and shows little to no evidence of innovative activity in that dimension.

* **Definition:** The company does not innovate or innovates very little. There is no formal strategy or process for this dimension 1\.  
* **Indicators:**  
* **Offerings:** The product line has remained unchanged for years; no new significant products introduced recently 2, 3\.  
* **Process:** Operations follow standard industry norms with no attempt to improve or differentiate 4\.  
* **Customers:** The company sells to the same customer base without seeking new segments or unmet needs 5\.

#### Score 3: Occasional Innovator ("The Reactive Company")

A score of 3 represents a company that innovates sporadically. Innovation happens, but it is often a one-off event or a reaction to a crisis rather than a deliberate strategy.

* **Definition:** The firm has innovated in the last 3 years, but it is not a systematic process. Innovation is an event, not a habit 1\.  
* **Indicators:**  
* **Offerings:** New products are launched occasionally (e.g., once every 3 years), but without a consistent pipeline 1\.  
* **Brand:** The brand is recognized, but brand extensions are rare or tentative 6\.  
* **Organization:** Cross-functional teams are assembled only when a specific problem arises, then disbanded 7\.

#### Score 5: Systemic Innovator ("The World-Class Company")

A score of 5 is reserved for companies where innovation is ingrained in the DNA of the organization. It is continuous, intentional, and creates substantial value.

* **Definition:** The company practices innovation management systematically. It has a proven track record of repeated success in this dimension 1\.  
* **Indicators:**  
* **Offerings:** There is a continuous stream of new products or services that lead the market 2, 8\.  
* **Platform:** The company systematically uses modular components to efficiently create diverse offerings (e.g., a shared "production system") 9\.  
* **Presence:** The company has successfully opened entirely new channels or markets that competitors have not yet entered 10\.

### Scoring Guide for Key Dimensions

You can use this quick reference table to help clients decide between a 1, 3, or 5 during the assessment:  
Dimension,Score 1 (Passive),Score 3 (Occasional),Score 5 (Systemic)  
OFFERINGS,Sells standard products; no recent changes.,"Launched a new product recently, but it was an isolated event.","Regularly launches new products/services that lead the market 1, 2."  
CUSTOMERS,Serves existing customers only; ignores new segments.,Investigates new needs when sales drop; ad-hoc research.,Systematically identifies and enters new customer segments 6\.  
PROCESSES,Uses standard industry processes; focuses on maintenance.,Updates processes occasionally to fix broken workflows.,"Uses proprietary, highly efficient processes (e.g., Lean/Six Sigma) as a competitive edge 4."  
PRESENCE,"Sells through traditional, established channels only.","Has experimented with a new channel (e.g., a website) recently.",Has created entirely new distribution channels or innovative points of presence 10\.  
BRAND,Brand is just a name/logo; no leverage.,Brand has been used for a few simple extensions.,Brand is a powerful asset leveraged into entirely new categories 9\.

### How to Interpret the Final Score

Once you have scored all 12 dimensions, calculate the average to determine the client's overall **Innovation Magnitude**:

* **Total Score ≥ 4:** **Systemic Innovator.** The client is a market leader with robust innovation capabilities 1\.  
* **3 ≤ Total Score \< 4:** **Occasional Innovator.** The client innovates, but lacks consistency. They are vulnerable to disruption 1\.  
* **Total Score \< 3:** **Little/Not Innovative.** The client is stagnant and at high risk of obsolescence 1\.
