Based on the comprehensive frameworks detailed in your sources, specifically the **Innovation Radar** developed by Sawhney et al. and the **INOVA-tec** contextualization method, I have designed an **Innovation Power Assessment Tool**.  
This tool is structured for you to use directly with clients to diagnose their current innovation strengths, identify neglected opportunities, and benchmark their progress.

### The Innovation Power Assessment Tool

**Overview:**This tool moves beyond the narrow view of innovation as merely "new product development" or "R\&D." Instead, it scores a company across **12 distinct dimensions** of their business system. Innovation is defined here as the creation of substantial new value for customers and the firm by creatively changing one or more of these dimensions 1, 2\.  
**Instructions for the Consultant:**

1. **Assessment:** Interview key stakeholders or survey management using the 12 dimensions below.  
2. **Scoring:** Rate each dimension on a scale of **1 (Low/No Activity)** to **5 (World-Class/Systemic Innovation)**.  
3. **Contextualization:** Apply weighting if specific dimensions are more critical to the client's specific industry (e.g., "Supply Chain" may carry more weight for a logistics firm than a boutique consultancy) 3\.  
4. **Visualization:** Plot the scores on a radar (spider) chart to visualize the client's current "innovation profile" 4, 5\.

#### Part 1: The Four Key Anchors

These four dimensions serve as the "business anchors" of the framework 6\.  
**1\. Offerings (WHAT)***Focus: The firm’s core products and services.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** To what extent does the company introduce new products or services with significantly improved features or performance that are valued by customers? 7  
* **Indicator:** Look for a high rate of new product introduction or services that are unique in the market (e.g., Apple's iPod) 8\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**2\. Customers (WHO)***Focus: The individuals or organizations that consume the offerings.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** How effectively does the company discover unmet customer needs or identify underserved customer segments? 9  
* **Indicator:** Look for entry into new demographic segments (e.g., Virgin Mobile targeting youth) or meeting unarticulated needs 10\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**3\. Processes (HOW)***Focus: The configurations of business activities used to conduct internal operations.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the company redesign core operating processes to improve efficiency, higher quality, or faster cycle time? 11, 12  
* **Indicator:** Look for proprietary methodologies or operational shifts (e.g., Toyota Production System, or outsourcing non-core tasks) 13, 12\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**4\. Presence (WHERE)***Focus: The channels and places where offerings can be bought or used.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Has the company created new distribution channels or innovative points of presence? 14  
* **Indicator:** Look for creative usage of channels, such as banking kiosks in grocery stores or direct-to-consumer models (e.g., Dell) 15, 16\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

#### Part 2: The Eight Supporting Dimensions

These dimensions bridge the anchors and offer often-overlooked avenues for innovation 17\.  
**5\. Platform***Focus: Common components or building blocks.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the company use modular components, shared assets, or common technologies to create a diverse set of derivative offerings efficiently? 18  
* **Indicator:** Look for a "platform" approach where one base supports multiple products (e.g., Nissan using one engine block for different car models) 19\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**6\. Solutions***Focus: Integrated combinations of products, services, and information.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the firm offer customized, integrated packages that solve end-to-end customer problems rather than just selling standalone products? 20  
* **Indicator:** Look for bundles that handle a customer's pain point completely (e.g., UPS offering logistics, financing, and shipping management) 21\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**7\. Customer Experience***Focus: Redesigning interactions across all touchpoints.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** How much innovation is put into the way customers see, hear, and feel the brand during interactions? 22  
* **Indicator:** Look for enhancements to the "feel" of doing business, such as Starbucks creating a "third place" environment 23\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**8\. Value Capture***Focus: Revenue streams and payment mechanisms.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Has the company discovered untapped revenue streams or developed novel pricing systems? 11  
* **Indicator:** Look for creative monetization, such as Google's paid search or subscription models for software 24\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**9\. Organization***Focus: Structure, roles, and incentives.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Has the company redefined employee roles, responsibilities, or organizational structures to foster innovation? 25  
* **Indicator:** Look for unique internal structures, such as cross-functional teams or organizing around customer segments rather than products 26\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**10\. Supply Chain***Focus: Sourcing and fulfillment.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the company innovate in how it moves information and goods from source to delivery? 27  
* **Indicator:** Look for rapid fulfillment capabilities or collaborative planning with suppliers (e.g., Zara's fast fashion supply chain) 28\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**11\. Networking***Focus: Interconnectedness and intelligent networks.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the company enhance the value of its offerings by connecting them through a network? 29  
* **Indicator:** Look for network-centric advantages, like OTIS using remote monitoring for elevators or CEMEX using satellite tracking for cement delivery 30\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

**12\. Brand***Focus: Leveraging symbols and promises into new domains.*

* **Diagnostic Question:** Does the company leverage its brand into new domains or categories creatively? 22, 30  
* **Indicator:** Look for successful brand extensions, such as Virgin extending its brand from music to airlines and mobile phones 31\.  
* **Score (1-5):** \_\_\_\_\_\_

#### Part 3: Analysis & Interpretation

**1\. Calculate the Innovation Magnitude**To get a single "Innovation Power" metric, you can calculate the **Magnitude Index** (adapted from INOVA-tec).

* *Formula:* Sum the weighted scores of all dimensions and divide by the number of dimensions 32\.  
* *Interpretation:*  
* **High Performance:** Score \> 4 (Systemic Innovator) 33\.  
* **Average Performance:** Score 3 \- 4 (Occasional Innovator) 33\.  
* **Low Performance:** Score \< 3 (Little or no Innovation) 33\.

**2\. Visualize the Radar**Plot the scores on a radar chart.

* **Round Shape:** Indicates a balanced, systemic innovation strategy (e.g., Apple's iPod touched on Offerings, Platform, Supply Chain, Presence, and Brand) 34\.  
* **Spiked Shape:** Indicates a focused strategy (e.g., a bank focusing heavily on "Presence" and "Brand" but ignoring "Processes") 35\.

**3\. Identify Gaps (The "Blue Ocean")**Use the chart to show clients where their competitors are bunching up. If every competitor is innovating on "Offerings" (product features), advise your client to look at neglected dimensions like "Customer Experience" or "Value Capture" to gain a competitive advantage 36, 37\.
